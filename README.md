# Colossus Website - Group Project

Our website design was based of the design Daniel R, Callum, and Archie had made together, however, we used the sitemap created by Dishant, Daniel C and Karthi.
Daniel R created a base template for everyone to work with, including the navbar, header and a base box that could be used within the page. Along with the basic CSS and image that to style the website.

This was done to ensure the pages all had the same design and made it much easier for us to work on the website.

Each of us took one page to work on:
FAQ: Karthi
Contact: Dishant
Location: Archie
Home: Callu
About: Daniel C
References: Daniel R

After all the pages were complete, Daniel R went though and make a few changes to make the overall website look and feel nicer for the users visiting the page.
