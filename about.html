                    Colossus reduced the time to work out the Lorenz chi-wheel settings and enabled more messages to be
                    deciphered and the whole code-breaking operation to be accelerated. The information gleaned from the
                    decrypted messages is widely acknowledged to have shortened the war by many months, saving tens of
                    thousands of lives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The cipher text was input via paper tape and the 2500 valves of Colossus would find the Lorenz machine
                    chi-wheel settings.

                    By the end of the war, 63 million characters of high-grade German communications had been decrypted by
                    550 people helped by the ten Colossus computers.

                    Not until 1975 when the first information about Colossus was declassified could the story begin to be
                    told.

                    In 1992, Tony Sale and his team began the ambitious task of rebuilding a working Colossus. They succeeded
                    and in 2007 it was tested in the global Colossus Cipher Challenge. Once again Colossus was able to crack
                    the Lorenz code (in 3.5 hours), but was beaten in the race by Joachim Schueth, a professional computer
                    software engineer, who wrote special software for his PC to break the ciphertext in just 46 seconds! In
                    2012, a major fundraising campaign, led by TNMOC trustee Tim Reynolds, was launched to convert the old
                    Colossus workshop room into a brand new Gallery. Much work has still to be done to complete perhaps the
                    world's most exciting computing exhibit, but already Colossus is viewable by the public as never before
                    and is set to inspire future generations of engineers and computer scientists.

                    Tommy Flowers spent eleven months designing and building Colossus at the Post Office Research Station,
                    Dollis Hill, in North West London. After a functional test, Colossus Mk 1 was delivered to Bletchley Park
                    in late December 1943 / January 1944, was assembled there by Harry Fensom and Don Horwood, and was
                    working in early February 1944. Colossus was the first of the electronic digital machines with
                    programmability, albeit limited in modern terms. The notion of a computer as a general purpose machine -
                    that is, as more than a calculator devoted to solving difficult but specific problems - would not become
                    prominent for several years. Colossus was preceded by several computers, many of them being a first in
                    some category. Colossus, however, was the first that was digital, programmable, and electronic. The first
                    fully programmable digital electronic computer capable of running a stored program was still some way off
                    - the 1948 Manchester Small Scale Experimental Machine. The use to which the Colossi were put was of the
                    highest secrecy, and Colossus itself was highly secret, and remained so for many years after the War.
                    Colossus was not included in the history of computing hardware for decades, and Flowers and his
                    associates were deprived of the recognition they were due for many years. It has taken nearly fifteen
                    years to rebuild the Mark II Colossus computer in the same position as Colossus 9 originally occupied in
                    Block H. Using only scraps of diagrams, old pictures and half-forgotten memories Tony Sale and his team
                    re-created this fantastic world-first for Britain and set the benchmark for computer conservation. For
                    further information about how the Colossus story surfaced, and more details about the Colossus rebuild
                    project by the late Tony sale, click on the following links:

                <p>
                    RNIE was a hardware random number generator created to find winners each month for the premium bond prize
                    draw. A Premium Bond is a lottery bond issued by the United Kingdom government's National Savings and
                    Investments agency. The bonds are entered in a regular prize draw each month and can win various amounts
                    up to the current top prize of Â£1,000,000. The first ERNIE was built in 1956 by the Post Office Research
                    Station at Dollis Hill. The team that built it included some of the same team of engineers who built
                    Colossus, the world's first electronic computer. ERNIE was installed at Lytham St.Annes, a coastal town
                    in Lancashire, England, just south of Blackpool. ERNIE was designed by Harry Fensom, who worked in the
                    department run by Tommy Flowers, the designer of Colossus, and was built by a team lead by Sidney
                    Broadhurst. Before ERNIE 1 could be built, a test of the components to be used was required. So a small
                    test machine was built and later dubbed "Little ERNIE". As part of that process, a demonstration unit was
                    also built to show how the random number generation was calculated. As part of the Harry Fensom archive,
                    graciously donated to TNMOC, we have 2 documents that relate directly to ERNIE. The first is a general
                    description of the system, signed and dated by Harry Fensom, and possibly written by him, although that
                    cannot be confirmed.
